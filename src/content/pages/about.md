# About Us

Welcome to the Cotham Gardens School Parent, Teacher, and Friends Association (PTFA)! We are a friendly and active group of parents, carers, teachers, and friends who work together to support our school and enhance the educational experience for all our children.

## Our Mission

Our primary goal is to build a strong and vibrant school community where every child can thrive. We do this by:

- **Fundraising:** We organize a variety of fun events and activities throughout the year to raise money for school projects, equipment, and experiences that are not covered by the school's budget.
- **Building Community:** We aim to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for all families. Our events provide great opportunities for parents, staff, and children to get to know each other and have fun together.
- **Supporting the School:** We work closely with the school's leadership team to support their vision and provide practical help where needed.

## Who We Are

The PTFA is made up of a dedicated committee of volunteers who are elected each year at our Annual General Meeting (AGM). However, you don't need to be on the committee to get involved! Every parent, carer, and staff member at Cotham Gardens School is automatically a member of the PTFA, and we welcome all friends of the school to join us.

## Get Involved

There are many ways to support the PTFA, no matter how much time you have to spare. You can:

- **Come to our meetings:** We hold regular meetings to plan events and discuss new ideas. Everyone is welcome to attend.
- **Volunteer at an event:** Whether it's helping to set up, run a stall, or clear away afterwards, many hands make light work!
- **Share your skills:** Do you have a particular talent or skill that could help us? From graphic design to accounting, we'd love to hear from you.
- **Support our fundraisers:** Simply by coming along to our events and supporting our initiatives, you are making a valuable contribution.

We are always looking for new faces and fresh ideas. If you would like to find out more about the PTFA or get involved, please don't hesitate to get in touch with us.

Together, we can make a real difference to our school and our children's future. We look forward to welcoming you to the Cotham Gardens PTFA!
