# Welcome

We are the **P**arent, **T**eacher and **F**riends **A**ssociation for [Cotham Gardens Primary School](https://www.cothamgardens.co.uk/) in Bristol. Our goal is to raise money for the school and to help build a strong school community.

On this website you can find out more about what we do, see our upcoming [events](https://cothamgardensptfa.co.uk/events/), and find out how to get in touch.

Last academic year we were able to give **Â£14k** to the school for new musical instruments, sports day at Shine, author visits, the librarian, class enrichment activities & more!
