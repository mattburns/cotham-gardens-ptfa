## Our Mission

Making the school-run a safe and happy experience for our children, freinds and families.

## School Streets

A current key goal of this group is to install a [School Street](https://travelwest.info/projects/bristol-school-streets/). These are very popular in Bristol and create a brilliant environment to start the school day.

## Get Involved
