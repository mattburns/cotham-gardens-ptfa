There are three workshops on Saturday:

ðŸŒ² 11am-12noon

ðŸŒ² 1pm-2pm

ðŸŒ² 2.30pm-3.30pm

Come and join us to make your seasonal wreath!

ðŸŒ²
Saturdayâ€™s workshops are Family Friendly, with Childrenâ€™s tickets available and upgrades for a Hot/Soft Drink and a filled roll or Mince Pie/Cake too.

All materials are provided, but youâ€™re welcome to bring along anything extra or special you want to include in your wreath.
The workshops will be a relaxed environment with help and advice on hand if you need any- but lots of space if you donâ€™t!

Tickets will go on sale Friday 7th November!
Hope to see you there
