In May 2024, a group of staff & parents (including Ms Smith and Miss Bayat :) ran the Bristol 10k or half marathon and raised over Â£2.5k for the school. We'd love to be able to smash this total and so we need as many people to sign up to run either 10k or half marathon in 2026. Kids can join in too on the Saturday for a 1.5 or 2.5km run.

You don't have to be a runner right now. There is plenty of time. Last time one parent hadn't run for 5 years but started the Couch to 5k app and with the support of other parents built up gradually to run the 10k. As well as improving fitness, running is a great help for mental health.

To take part, sign up to the events here:
