# Play Street and Cake Sale

We're closing the road outside the Elmgrove site after school so everyone can play and eat cake! Any proceeds raised will go towards the PTFA.

## What is a "Play Street"?

Plays streets happen at hundreds of communities in the UK, but are proudly developed by Bristol parents back in 2009. Lots more information can be found on the [Playing Out](https://playingout.net/play-streets/what-are-play-streets/) website.
