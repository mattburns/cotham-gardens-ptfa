Friday 7 - 9pm. This is an Adult only workshop with a chance to upgrade your ticket to include a glass of wine or Prosecco with a mini Cheese Board.
Non-alcoholic alternatives are available too.

All materials are provided, but youâ€™re welcome to bring along anything extra or special you want to include in your wreath.
The workshops will be a relaxed environment with help and advice on hand if you need any- but lots of space if you donâ€™t!

Tickets will go on sale Friday 7th November!
Hope to see you there
