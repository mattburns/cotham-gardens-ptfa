ðŸ‘» ðŸŽƒ The famous Cotham Gardens SPOOKY DISCO is on Friday 17th October! ðŸ‘» ðŸŽƒ


Only children from the school and their parents can attend. Ticket numbers are limited and we donâ€™t want any children to miss out. 

There are 3 sessions - 
4:30 - 5:30 YR, Y1 & Y2
6:00 - 7:00 Y3 & Y4
7:15 - 8:15 Y5 & Y6
You need to be on classlist to be invited to the right session! 

- Maximum of 4 children per supervising adult. You must be able to look after all the children you bring.

- Please note that this event is being run by the Parent Teacherâ€™s and Friends Association, not the school - there will be no Cotham Gardenâ€™s teachers or staff available. You must make sure that you can be responsible for every child that attends with you.

- A limited number of free tickets are available for children and their carers in receipt of pupil premium. Please contact the school office to request one.

- All funds raised will be put towards enrichment activities for the children at the school. Please consider adding an optional donation to your ticket purchase.
